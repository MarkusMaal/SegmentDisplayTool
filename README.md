# SegmentDisplayTool
This program allows you to manipulate a virtual 7/8 segment display. It supports conversion to bits and vice versa. Currently there are two display types and for the LED display it is possible to change the colors.  You can also specifiy separators, which makes this a very nice tool for programmers who are dealing with segment display related problems.
